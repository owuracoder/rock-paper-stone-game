In this project, I am building an online platform for the common rock, scissors, stone we normally play when stuck with a decision that we mihgt need a random element to make a rather difficult decision. This project is part of the OT assignments as part of the process of learning to become a fullstack developer. In this project I learned a lot of useful techniques and I will write a blog post detailing my whole development process.
